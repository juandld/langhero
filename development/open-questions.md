# Open Questions

If a question is actually a founder/product decision, track it in `development/decision-board.md` so we can pick an option and lock it.

- Which streaming ASR provider best balances latency, reliability, and cost?
- Do we need on-device fallback for users without consistent Internet?
- How should we log and store streaming transcripts while respecting privacy?
- What visual design best communicates “lives” remaining during live streaming?
- Can we integrate teacher/coach overrides for scenario difficulty on the fly?
- For import caching/dedupe, what is the intended scope: per-user, per-org, or global opt-in (published artifacts only)?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Assign owners + due dates for each question as decisions emerge.
- [ ] Archive resolved items into linked docs to keep this list fresh.
