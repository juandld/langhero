# Open Questions

- Which streaming ASR provider best balances latency, reliability, and cost?
- Do we need on-device fallback for users without consistent Internet?
- How should we log and store streaming transcripts while respecting privacy?
- What visual design best communicates “lives” remaining during live streaming?
- Can we integrate teacher/coach overrides for scenario difficulty on the fly?

## Next Steps

- [ ] Assign owners + due dates for each question as decisions emerge.
- [ ] Archive resolved items into linked docs to keep this list fresh.
